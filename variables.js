//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/* Create a variable called 'myName' with a value that is your name as a string. */

/* Create a variable called 'faveNum' with a value that is your favorite number. */

//CODE HERE
let faveNum = 13

/* Create a variable called 'lovesCode' and assign it a boolean value. */

//CODE HERE

//////////////////PROBLEM 4////////////////////
/*
  Write an if-statement that checks if the faveNum variable is 
  equal to 13. If it is, console.log('lucky 13!'). 
  If it's not, console.log('not lucky 13').
*/

//CODE HERE
if ( faveNum === 13 ){

//Needed three equal signs to run this code correctly, instead of one which was initially thought.

//////////////////PROBLEM 5////////////////////
/*
  Write a for loop that prints out your faveNum 5 times.
*/

//CODE HERE
for ( let i = 0; i < 5; i++){

//gathered this for loop from slides, was able to write the correct format with slides.
